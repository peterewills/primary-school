# Anomaly Detection in Social Networks

This repo contains a notebook that pulls and analyzes face-to-face contact data
recorded in a French primary school in 2009. This analysis is for a project
listed on [my website][1]. The source of the data is
[here][2].

## Requirements

The notebook requires `networkx` and `netcomp` in order to run. Both are
available via `pip`, so just do

	pip install netcomp
	
and `networkx` will be installed as a dependency.
